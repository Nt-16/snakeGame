# Simple Snake Game with Raylib

This is a simple snake game implemented using the Raylib library in C++. The game features a snake that moves around the screen, eating food to grow longer. The player controls the snake's direction using arrow keys. The game ends when the snake collides with the edges of the screen or with itself.

## Features

- Control the snake's direction using arrow keys (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT).
- Snake grows longer each time it eats food.
- Game ends when the snake collides with the edges of the screen or with itself.
- Game restarts  after it ends if any arrow keys are pressed.

## How to Play

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Compile the source code using a C++ compiler that supports C++11 or later (e.g., g++, clang++).
3. Run the compiled executable.
4. Control the snake's direction using the arrow keys (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT).
